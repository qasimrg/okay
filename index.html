                        Universally known as ‘Nelson’ Mandela, this was not his birth name. 
                        In his autobiography, The Long <br> Walk to Freedom (1996), Mandela describes how he became known as Nelson: 
                        ‘No one in my family <br> had ever attended school. On the first day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, 
                        gave each of us an <br> English name. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due 
                        to <br> the British bias of our education. That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. <br> 
                        Why this particular name I have no idea.’ Mandela’s birth name, Rolihlahla, means ‘he who <br> shakes the branch 
                        of the tree’ or ‘troublemaker’ for short, 
                        an appropriate name for one who was <br> destined to overturn a regime and change the direction of the nation.
